Of Human Feelings is an album by American jazz saxophonist, composer, and bandleader Ornette Coleman. 
It was recorded on April 25, 1979, at CBS Studios in New York City with his band Prime Time (pictured), which featured guitarists Charlie Ellerbee and Bern Nix, bassist Jamaaladeen Tacuma, and drummers Calvin Weston and Coleman's son Denardo. 
It followed the saxophonist's failed attempt to record a direct-to-disc session earlier in the same year and was the first jazz album to be recorded digitally in the United States. The album's jazz-funk music continued Coleman's harmolodic approach to improvisation with Prime Time. He also drew on rhythm and blues influences from earlier in his career, and applied free jazz principles from his music during the 1960s to elements of funk. Following a change in management, Coleman signed with Island Records, and the album was released in 1982 by its subsidiary label Antilles Records. 
Critics generally praised the album's expressive music and harmolodic approach, but it made little commercial impact. (Full article...)
